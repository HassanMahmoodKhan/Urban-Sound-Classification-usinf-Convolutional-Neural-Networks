# Urban-Sound-Classification-usinf-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

Convolutional neural networks are widely used in the fields of image and signal processing, audio classification, document analysis etc. 
Over the years, extensive research has been carried out in the domain of audio classification via implementation of convolutional networks. In this regard, researchers have used a variety of datasets with ESC-10, ESC-50, UrbanSound8k etc., being the prominent ones offering access to a large variety of audio samples. 

This project makes use of convolutional neural networks to effectivly distinguish urban sounds from our everyday environment. For this purpose, a deep-learning model consisting of 3 convolutional layers with max-pooling and last convolution layer with the GlobalAveragePooling2D has been implemented.
