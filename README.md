# Urban-Sound-Classification-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

Convolutional neural networks are widely used in the fields of image and signal processing, audio classification, document analysis etc. 
Over the years, extensive research has been carried out in the domain of audio classification via implementation of convolutional networks. In this regard, researchers have used a variety of datasets with ESC-10, ESC-50, UrbanSound8k etc., being the prominent ones offering access to a large variety of audio samples. 

In the recent past, it has been observed that pedestrians all over the world are becoming increasingly prone to accidents due to the lack of awareness of incoming obstacles in their nearby surroundings. The project aims to curtail this threat by using sound as a tool of detecting potential hazards, making the accuracy of classification imperative. As a result, pedestrians will be made aware of the approaching threats in the environment.In this regard, the use of convolutional neural networks to effectivly distinguish urban sounds from our everyday environment. The accuracy of this network has been evaluated on UrbanSound8k, a publicly available dataset with over 8,700 audio samples.
