# Urban-Sound-Classification-usinf-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

Convolutional neural networks are widely used in the fields of image and signal processing, audio classification, document analysis etc. 
Over the years, extensive research has been carried out in the domain of audio classification via implementation of convolutional networks. In this regard, researchers have used a variety of datasets with ESC-10, ESC-50, UrbanSound8k etc. being the prominent ones offering access to a large variety of audio samples. In spite of the considerable success of the existing networks, one still feels that by implementing an alternative approach, a higher level of accuracy can be achieved.
